// QUESTION 2:
// Search the Defective Coin: Imagine you are working as the quality-control engineer
// for a company that makes coins. The company needs to certify that all the coins must
// have exactly identical weights. During your inspection, you have observed that one of
// the workers is watching the mobile phone while giving final shape to a coin. When you
// confront the worker suddenly, in reflex, he dropped that one coin into a pile of other
// (n−1) perfectly identical weighted coins. After your confrontation, the worker agreed that 
// he was not attentive and had been shaping the coin for more than the desired duration. 
// However, he could not be sure whether the weight of the coin was less due to excessive 
// shaping or remained perfect, but certain that the weight of the coin must not be more than 
// the required weight. It is your job to find that one possible defective coin that is 
// lighter than the others or possibly none, if, fortunately, the worker has made the perfect
// coin with exact required weight. Being a Computer science graduate, your task is to 
// determine which of the coins is lighter (defective) or report that none is lighter.Inorder
// to accomplish this task, you have been provided with a balance weighing scale. Using the
// balance weighing scale and necessary implementation,provide a divide and conquer algorithm
// to find the lighter (defective) coin, if present or not, in log2 n + c time, constant c
